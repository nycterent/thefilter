# Newsletter Generation Requirements

## Success Criteria

### Critical Success Requirement
**If newsletter post is not online - the generation/action must fail (it is not considered as success)**

The newsletter generation workflow should only be marked as successful if:

1. ✅ Content is successfully generated
2. ✅ Quality checks pass
3. ✅ Newsletter is successfully published to the target platform (Buttondown, etc.)
4. ✅ Published newsletter is verified to be accessible online
5. ✅ All external dependencies complete successfully

### Failure Conditions

The workflow should fail if any of these occur:
- Content generation fails
- Quality validation fails (critical issues)
- Publication to target platform fails
- Published content is not accessible/verified online
- API timeouts or connectivity issues prevent publication
- Authentication failures with publishing platform

### Implementation Notes

- Add post-publication verification step
- Implement retry logic for transient failures
- Distinguish between content generation success and publication success
- Only create success notifications after full pipeline completion including online verification

## Current Status

**TODO**: Implement online verification step in newsletter generation workflow to ensure published content is accessible before marking as successful.

**Location**: This requirement should be implemented in the newsletter generation GitHub Actions workflow and the core newsletter.py module.
